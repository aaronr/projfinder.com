"""
Provides a subclass of Disk Cache which saves in a simple z/x/y.extension, with
Y=0 being the top of the map, and heading down. This tile layout makes for
generation of tiles that is friendly to Google/OSM, and the opposite of TMS.
This is useful for pre-generating tiles for Google Maps which are going to be
used offline. This allows one to use TileCache in a gdal2tiles-like setup,
using the cache to write out a directory which can be used in other places.

Note that ext3 (a common Linux filesystem) will not support more than 32000
files in a directory, so if you plan to store a whole world at z15 or greater,
you should not use this cache class. (The Disk.py file is designed for this use
case.)
