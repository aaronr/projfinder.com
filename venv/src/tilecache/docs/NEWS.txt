tilecache-1.9, Wed,  5 Sep 2007 11:14:16 -0400
 * Fix longstanding bug which made some non-geographic projections difficult
   to create tiles with
 * Add more informative error message output via TileCacheExceptions  
 * Fix for "MetaLayer.getMetaSize is too conservative"
 * Report OSErrors more cleanly in tilecache_clean.py
 * Better support for Jython in DiskCache class.
 * Add support for extent_type=loose to allow out of bounds tile requests
 * Improved tilecache_seed to only grab one metaTile from each set -- 
   this drastically reduces the number of requests to precache metatiled
   layers. Also fixed off-by-one error where seed was requesting too many
   tiles.
 * Add tms_type=google to specify that the TMS layer should go down instead
   of up.
 * Add setting of labelcache_map_edge_buffer to the MapServer layer if one
   does not exist on the map object.
 * Make mapnik layer respect layers= config if provided.
 * Remove getClosestLevel, no longer used or neccesary.  
 * Better Lockfile removal, from Paul Spencer

 * Only use metaTiling if metatile=yes, true, or 1 
 * Minor change to WMS layer dispatching to handle GDAL WMS Driver 
   compatability.

tilecache-1.8, Fri,  4 May 2007 07:31:38 -0400
 * Patch to ImageLayer from Volker Mische add:
   * Optional transparency to images which are not transparent. This allows 
     the images to be transparent outside the maxExtent of the image.
   * Resize scaling method specification 
 * Add support for tile watermarking, patch by Andrew Hughes. 
 * Allow for definition of 'styles' parameter in WMSLayer tilecache
   cfg -- don't send blank parameters to the backend.

tilecache-1.7, Fri, 13 Apr 2007 20:34:42 -0400
 * Apache will sometimes kill TileCache, leaving around locks. If we can't 
   lock for > cache.timeout seconds, throw an exception with the lockname,
   so that users can cleanup. Reported by Brock Anderson, who had stuck locks
   for several days.
 * If ImageLayer base image is transparent, make output Image transparent too.
   Report and patch by Brian Victor.
 * Add support for forcing client to reload on errors, by Suki Hirata.
 * Add support for not caching data which is not images for WMS, with
   original support written by Suki Hirata.
 * Minor fixups to TMS metadata, from Suki Hirata.

 * Fix metaTile support:
   * Data was offset downwards by metaBuffer pixels.
   * metabuffer and metasize parsing was not working.
 * Add support for palatted transparency when using metaTiling. Patch by

tilecache-1.2, Mon Dec  4 01:15:41 EST 2006
 * Add support for WorldWind style requests, courtesy of Emily Gouge, from
   Refractions.
 * Add support for MapnikLayer for rendering.
 * Add support for rendering using metatiles: instead of rendering one tile
   at a time, render a 5x5 tileset, and then slice the tiles up. Good for
   vector layers, where labels crossing tile boundaries is useful. 
   To turn on, use 'metaTile=yes' in layer definition. Requires 
   Python-Imaging.
 * Improved TMS metadata
 * Fix TileCache to work on Python 2.2
 * Fix TileCache to work on Windows.

tilecache-1.1, Fri Nov 17 14:56:56 EST 2006

 * Add support for bounding box passed on command line to Client.py
 * Change cache to use local layer name for creating caches instead of
   remote layer list. After installing 1.1, if you have DiskCaches 
   where the local layer name does not match the remote layer name,
   you should move your directory after installing tilecache-1.1.
 
tilecache-1.0, Fri Nov 10 13:14:02 EST 2006
 * Initial Release
