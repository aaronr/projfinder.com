# Configuration for MC TileCache

# TileCache can load Layers or Caches from anywhere in sys.path. If you 
# prefer to load from somewhere which is *not* on sys.path, you can use
# the path configuration paramter to set a comma-seperated list of 
# filesystem paths which you want prepended to sys.path.
#[tilecache_options]
#path=/home/you

# Some TileCache options are controlled by metadata. One example is the
# crossdomain_sites option, which allows you to add sites which are then
# included in a crossdomain.xml file served from the root of the TileCache

#crossdomain_sites=openstreetmap.org,openaerialmap.org
